			It is sheer impossibility and a humungous task to try to capture and encapsulate the works of Kwame Nkrumah (MHSRIP) in a single article like this one. That being the case, I shall not touch on his works as a Prime Minister or President of Ghana, but rather I will zero in on his person. Kwame Nkrumah was born Francis Kofi Nwiah at Nkroful, in Western Ghana on 21st September 1909 and he died on 27th April 1972 in Bucharest, Romania from cancer.</p>
		<p>		
			Before his death, he was living in exile in Conakry, Guinea, where President Sekou Toure had made him a symbolic co-President, following his overthrow in a coup d’état on 24th February 1966. Before then, Ghana, Guinea and Mali had formed a troika, perhaps a harbinger of things to come in 1975, when ECOWAS was established through the instrumentality of Generals Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo and General Yakubu Gown of Nigeria. Nkrumah suffered seven assassination attempts, including the botched shooting incident at Flagstaff House, where Sergeant Amatewee shot and killed Nkrumah’s bodyguard, Salifu Dagarti (MHSRIP).</p>
		<p>
			That incident occurred in 1964. Before then, there was the Kulungugu grenade attack at the border between Ghana and Upper Volta, (now Burkina Faso), on 11 August 1962, for which some of Nkrumah’s close confidants and CPP stalwarts got implicated, namely Kofi Crabbe, Ako Adjei and Tawiah Adamafio. Hired accomplices were named as Asaba Quarcoo, Mama Tula, among others. All were arrested and charged as the culprits in a protracted treason trial, with Gyeke Darko being the DPP and Alhaji Kwaw Swanzy the Attorney General. Nkrumah departed the shores of the Gold Coast to go to the USA in 1935, after his teacher training education at Achimota College.
